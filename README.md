# Data Manipulation & Data Visualisation 
Data Manipulation is the process of exploring given data and converting unstructured and raw data to
structured data for easier analysis that include -filtering, sorting, modifying, creating new data from existing,
summarising, arranging, deleting,slicing,inserting data, etc. Summarising data also gives clarity and insights

Data Visualisation refers to the process of transforming the huge real life complex dataframes into
graphs i.e. graphical representation of data. It is an efficient way of analysing patterns and trends of
and understanding the context and significance.

# Goal
In this self excersise, I explored RStudio for the first time using common packages such as ``dyplr`` ``ggplot`` and ``ggcorrplot``
My goal was to become familliar with using RStudio and some of it's common packages.
